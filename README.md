# Hackintosh-Dell-Latitude-E5440
This is the configuration I use for my Dell Latitude E5440 laptop. It is working fairly well (see README on the clover branch for details).

#### Disclaimer:
The following repo is just here for reference purposes. I discourage anyone to just copy the repo to their EFI folder, as this configuration is not perfect and may be outdated. I suggest you make your configuration by reading [Dortania's OpenCore guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config-laptop.plist/haswell.html#deviceproperties) and to use mine as a reference if needed.
