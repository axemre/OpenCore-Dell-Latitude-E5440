# OpenCore Hackintosh - Dell Latitude E5440
This is the OpenCore configuration I have used (thanks to r33int) on my Dell Latitude E5440 to boot Catalina (not yet tested with Big Sur). It's working well, it may have broken features tho. See 
[Dortania's OpenCore guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config-laptop.plist/haswell.html#deviceproperties) for more information. 

#### Disclaimer:
The following repo is just here for reference purposes. This configuration may be outdated, so I suggest you to make your configuration by reading [Dortania's OpenCore guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config-laptop.plist/haswell.html#deviceproperties) and to use mine as a reference. You may have a slightly different model, which has got different components installed, making your own config is always the best choice!
